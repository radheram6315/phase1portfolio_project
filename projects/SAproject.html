<ul class="about-indent">
<li>PL/CL developer dedicating my time developing supporting PC/BC AMP and GPA systems.</li>
<li>Currently technically leading a team of offshore and onshore developers and actively working on efforts that create better/safe/secure/robust systems with less downtime and improved quote times. Proactively creating dashboards, looking at logs, performance issues, addressing user issues with minimal or no disruptions, 
<li>Diligently providing technical requirements to the release team on various improvement and release cards to maintain the system health and intended function correctly and consistently.
<li>Performing code reviews and providing suggestions to developers to maintain system integrity. Following better engineering practices improved RVT testing/ CICD automation/smoke tests.
<li>Designed a thorough process for the rating team so that prod log errors are addressed and handled in timely manner seamlessly. Leading a team of developers created and streamlined error handling process in the rating team. With the new process in place errors are handled by the team from discovery/analysis phase to solution without being lost. It happens seamlessly even though someone is out, or someone drops the ball. It would no longer depend on one person. For tracking purpose new errors are logged into a sheet and are assigned within the rating team on rotation basis.
<li>Added profiler tags and timing context messages to BBCU/CPP/Farm/WC Rating Engines and quote processing modules for tracking time spent on each individual quote at a higher level and track times within the quoting process at a detailed and deeper level of coverage / vehicle / building / jurisdiction /line and other details based on the LOB. Ran profiler sessions and captured stats and where required made code changes to improve performance.
<li>Proactively worked with business in adding PC UI validations where required to address failed quotes and in turn reducing the numbers of quotes needing manual intervention during processing. Worked on enhancing rating business logic to correct premium calculations and in turn reducing the numbers of quotes needing UW intervention and saving $ (need to update) 
<li>Using log rocket videos, coordinated with other product teams - where required worked to get portal validations added and enhanced business logic so that the user experience is better, and quotes do not fail. Coordinated with PC UI teams on coverage errors and made sure the product model is configured correctly. 
<li>Working with Log rocket team to create dashboard in Log Rocket so that rating failures from Portal can be identified and handled.
<li>Performed data consistency checks on rating tables improving data accessibility performance.
<li>Created Splunk dashboards for BAP, BOP, small CU, CP7, GL, WC7 which can be leveraged with PC9 dashboard to analyze long running quotes. These Splunk dashboards have also been very useful in debugging rating failures improving the times taken in error handling.
<li>Provided KT sessions to share and guide team members how they can analyze the error logs / profiler sessions/create Splunk dashboards/analyze log rocket videos/deep dive long running quotes. Simulated prod errors in lower environments helping business see the issues and drive them to provide solutions that helps to make the system robust.
<li>Using the metrices from Splunk dashboard leading the team to develop performance trackers and calculators for average quote times.

<h1>EXCEED, V6, V7</h1>
<ul class="about-indent">
<li>Played a significant and key role as Primary Exceed developer and Rockhill Billing developer dedicating my time supporting both the systems.</li>
<li>Involved in developing enhancements, defect fixes of both PC & BC for RH PAS reducing the backlog items for BC significantly.</li>
<li> To support the business needs and day-to-day operations of state auto worked on various defects enhancements/CCDS that involved changing Exceed billing programs. Managed multiple projects simultaneously. Completed assignments on time with high quality. There were none or minimal issues after the code deployment.</li>
<li> Provided production support 24*7 and handled development efforts to resolve critical incidents related to Exceed Billing cycles. This reduced the downtime of the Exceed system and enabled good customer</li>
<li>Created documentation and cross trained team members so there is no single point failure.</li>
<li>Created Job flow documentation for disaster recovery and DC1 migration</li>
<li>Contributed to continuous improvement initiatives of the Exceed Billing system and automation of handling daily errors without manual intervention. This eliminated 3 hours of manual work in the daily tasks of prod support handing and also minimized human errors.</li>
<li>Among many others successfully developed and implemented the new remittance processing, 3rd party payments, EFT processing for commercial lines, Account Bill, Custom Fit, Automated EFT rejection processing and Sweep processing for agency upload. These implementations and product enhancements have significantly increased business for state auto.</li>
<li>Actively involved in the development effort during the migration of CSC Series 3 Billing System for all personal lines, including EFT processing.</li>
<li>Actively involved in the development effort during the migration of CSC OS2 Series 3 Billing system to Exceed.</li>
