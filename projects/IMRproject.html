<h1>ISIS, Target</h1>
<p>ISIS (In Store Information System) ran under the OS/2 operating system utilizing DB2. The project was involved with the migration of the new application to a new client server architecture utilizing Windows NT and SOL server. Visual C++ and C were used. I was involved in coding and unit testing the programs.
 For the efforts involved received a Team Excellence Award from the client.</p>
